## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
I have hundreds of bookmarks saved in browser to resources I found that have helped me before or that I saved because I thought "Maybe I can use this some day". Although I have separate folders for different topics, this way of storing websites, articles, etc. is cumbersome and makes it very difficult to find what I am looking for.

I recently found this [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-not-to-be-overwhelmed-with-data-science-5a95ff1618f8) on Towards Data Science which described an alternative method to manage resources: with Issues in a GitHub repo. I want to try this for my resources as well. [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/khuyentran1401/machine-learning-articles) is the source of inspiration for my implementation.
